In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "1- 'RM': Increasing the 'RM' value will lead to increasing in the home's value because a home with 8 rooms should be valued more than a home with just 2 rooms. So increasing 'RM' will lead to incresing in the 'MEDV' value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- 'LSTAT': Decresing 'LSTAT' will lead to increasing in the home's value. Because a home located in an area which has a low percentage of the lower class than the uper/middle classes would be an indecation that the value of the homes in this area should be high because only the middle/upper classes could afford it. So Decresing 'LSTAT' will lead to Incresing in 'MEDV'\n",
    "\n",
    "3- 'PTRATIO': Decresing 'PTRATIO' will lead to increading in the home's value. Because it means that the neigbrhood has the a better public school which may reflect that clients who care for their childeren's education will find it an advantage. So Decresing 'PTRATIO' will lead to incresing in 'MEDV' value and vice versa. "

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

The previous methodology works good with models that has one parameter, but in case of a model has more than one hayper parameter, we need to use something like Grid Search. We can think of a Grid Search as a table with different parameters. i.e SVM model has 2 parameters such as C, and Kernal. listing the potential values of C and Kernal in a table and pass it to grid seach associated with the desired score such as 'f1_score', can help in getting the best possible combination of those two parameters 'C, Kernel' that scores the best results on the scoring function 'f1_score'.\n",

The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*.
